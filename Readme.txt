This project is in progress.

Starting from a lightbox example provided at https://codepen.io/KielBautista/pen/mxWNOb

Responsive Gallery with Lightbox
A PEN BY King Jhessrael Bautista

I am adding functionality

– I removed Font Awesome Icons and added JavaScript to the original file to build and style SVG icons.

– Currently I am adding Titles and Cutlines to the modal. The titles and cutlines are breaking. New titles/captions are added but they do not disappear as the next image+title+caption load. The code I added is in or below the for loop.

I need help. please contact me with suggestions at cwebba1@gmail.com
