042620 CWebba Vanilla-JS_Lightbox-Slider v5 and v8 READ ME

This project is in progress.

I started from this lightbox example on Codepen at: 

https://codepen.io/KielBautista/pen/mxWNOb
Responsive Gallery with Lightbox
A PEN BY King Jhessrael Bautista


I added functions and styles. Currently I wish to add Titles and Cutlines to the modal.

I need help. The titles and cutline function is breaking. New titles and captions appear as I change photos but they do not disappear as the next image+title+caption load. The code I added is in or below the for loop.

I am using data attributes within the HTML to add the titles and cutlines. I need help with the for loop function and how to iterate through multiple actions using the looping function.

Please contact me with suggestions at cwebba1@gmail.com
